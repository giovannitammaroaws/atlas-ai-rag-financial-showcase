# 07 - Audit

The Audit view is the operational trace layer of the platform.

What Audit is used for:
- inspect recent query executions
- verify provider, retrieval depth, and token behavior
- detect anomalies, repeated failures, or unexpected traffic patterns
- support post-incident analysis with concrete evidence

In short, Audit is where technical transparency and reliability checks happen.
